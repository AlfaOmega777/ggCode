        I hope this challenge meets your expectations as I would love to work
        with these technologies every day. While my experience in these
        technologies is not extensive, as I can only dedicate myself
        to them in personal projects outside of working hours, I am genuinely passionate about
        them and would like to master them. I believe my enthusiasm, responsibility, and
        ability to learn are key factors that I could contribute
        to your company. I am aware that this challenge has many areas for improvement...
        Styles, Responsiveness, Validations, Testing, Security, but I think it is a basic
        implementation that fulfills the required functionality.
        Either way, if you need me to demonstrate application of design patterns,
        a better division of responsibilities between modules, better session management and
        security, please let me know and I will do it without problems, only it will take me
        more time.
      </p>
